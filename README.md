# ChillAI: A neural network toolkit
Very basic code for machine learning that can be used in Unity

How to use:

Make an empty GameObject and attach a Core.cs script to it. This will be your network controller.

Attach a Network.cs script to your GameObject that you want to become your model.

Open the Network.cs script and program your network using the comments as instructions.

Go to your network controller and enter the settings you want to use for the training session.

Press play in the editor and begin training!
