# ChillAI: A neural network toolkit
Very basic code for machine learning that can be used in Unity

*This is my first time building a neural network toolkit meant for other people to use. If you have any suggestions or tips as to how to make this project better, it would be great if you could share them with me.
Thank you*

How to use:
Make an empty GameObject and attach a Core.cs script to it. This will be your network controller.
Attach a Network.cs script to your GameObject that you want to become your model.
Open the Network.cs script and program your network using the comments as instructions.
Go to your network controller and enter the settings you want to use for the training session.
Press play in the editor and begin training!
