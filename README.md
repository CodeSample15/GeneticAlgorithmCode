# ChillAI: A neural network toolkit
Very basic code for machine learning that can be used in Unity

*This is my first time building a neural network toolkit meant for other people to use. If you have any suggestions or tips for me, it would be great if you could share them with me.
Thank you*

Download this code, import it into your Unity scene and start building a neural network based genetic algorithm! I'm in the process of making it more user friendly and easy to set up. When it's finished, I'll make a more useful tutorial on how to use the code. In the meantime, download the latest commit to this repository and look over the code if you want. It'll help a lot if you can share any useful suggestions to make this toolkit better.
