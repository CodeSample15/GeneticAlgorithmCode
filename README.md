# GeneticAlgorithmCode
Very basic code for machine learning that can be used in Unity

Please note that this code was not meant to be used as an actual library. It is just meant for me to try and figure out if I can make a simple code for a genetic algorithm. It would be awesome if anyone who stumbles across this could give me some tips, because I'm going to need a lot.

Thank you
